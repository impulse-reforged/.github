### 🌐 Who are we?
[impulse: Reforged](https://minerva-servers.com/impulse-reforged/discord) is a Garry's Mod community that hosts a semi-serious Half-Life 2 Roleplay server. We maintain and develop our own fully overhauled Garry's Mod framework, a reworked and improved version of the [original impulse framework](https://github.com/aLoneWitness/impulse).

### 🤝 How can I get involved?
Join our community on [Discord](https://minerva-servers.com/impulse-reforged/discord)! You can participate in announcements, connect with others, share memes, form groups, ask questions, and discuss development topics with our team.
